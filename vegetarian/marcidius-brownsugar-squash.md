# Marcidius' Family Brown Sugar Acorn Squash

## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 medium winter squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
- 6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter
- 6 medium fresh sage leaves, sliced thin
- Salt and ground black pepper

## Directions
1. Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and heat the oven to 400 degrees.
2. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.
3. Brush the oil on the foil and the cut sides of the squash.
4. Roast until a skewer inserted in the squash meets no resistance, about 40-50 minutes.  (Mine took 50 minutes, and I made sure that it was super soft…had a bad experience with a butternut squash once by undercooking it and then trying to serve it to 3 other people….not so great……
5.  When the squash is almost done, melt the butter in a small skillet over medium heat.
6. Add the sage and cook, swirling the pan occasionally, until the butter is golden brown and the sage is crisp, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove the skillet from the heat.
7.  Remove the squash from the oven and turn cut-side up and season with salt and pepper.
8.  Drizzle or brush with the sage butter sauce and serve immediately.
